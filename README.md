# Plotly Diploy

## Overview Analysis
Help Rosa, a microbiological researcher in a microbiological laboratory, to discover and document unidentified bacteria.  Specifically, to identify bacteria species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. 
### Purpose:
Rosa’s company has partnered with *Improbable Beef* a food startup company to research candidate species. Rosa believes the human body contains this species. She needs our help to build a dashboard that her fellow researchers and research participants can use to look up data that was collected from volunteers across the country. 

## Results:
Using a combination of **VS Code**, **Web browser**, **Command-line interface**, and **GitHub** we have developed a code that displays a couple of things about a test subject. 
1. By providing a drop down menu (see image below) a user can view different findings about the test subject.

2. Once a test subject is selected a *Demographic Info* table updates with the test subject basic information. (see below image)

3. And lastly, but not least three different graphs and charts are provided based on the bacteria findings for the specific test subject’s selected. (see below image)
   a. **Bar Graph** that displays top ten bacteria findings.

   b. **Gauge Chart** that informs the user of the frequency in which the test subject washed the area of the body being analyzed.

   c. **Bubble Chart** that presents the findings of all bacteria identified and the quantity in which it is present for the specific body area being researched.

## Summary:
Thanks to a little bit of coding, we have developed a dynamic web based dashboard that displays pertinent information about a test subject in a visually pleasing platform. (see below image for web browser display)
